**Mini-Project 2 - Multi-Class Classification of Obesity Levels**

You are working with a dataset collected from surveys conducted in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, which includes individual characteristics such as age, gender, dietary habits, and physical activity. The dataset contains labeled obesity risk categories representing multiple classes related to obesity levels.

You are asked to design and train a deep learning model to classify individuals into one of seven obesity-related categories, making this a structured multi-class classification task.
