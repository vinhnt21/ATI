**Mini-Project 2 - Structured Data Classification - Iris Flower Species**

The Iris dataset, originally collected by Edgar Anderson and widely used in machine learning, contains measurements of three different species of iris flowers collected by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data includes sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each flower.

You are asked to design and train a deep learning model to classify the species of the iris flower based on the given features. This is a multi-class classification task with three distinct classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica.

**Mini-Project 3 - Structured Data Regression - Boston House Prices**

This dataset contains information on housing prices in Boston suburbs collected by the U.S. Census Service. Features include crime rate, average number of rooms, property tax rate, and pupil-teacher ratio, among others.

You are asked to design and train a deep learning model to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (house prices), making this a regression task.
